This repository contains projects written in C++ language from September 2021 to December 2021. 


### ShapesDatabase

With the implementation of two-dimensional arrays and functions, this game of battleship is created. On an 11 x 11 board, the user can place five ships, of sizes ranging from 1 to 5 spaces. After placement, the user can play against the computer by trying to sink the computer's ships while the computer sinks the users'. 

### BlackJack

In this simplified version of BlackJack, I implemented the use of pseudo-random number generation, loops, and relational clauses in order design an interactive game. The user can play against the computer, which makes decisions based on the different conditions of the current game. 

### ChangeInCoins

The programs prompts the user for a certain input, more specifically a number between 0 and 100 (noninclusive). It will then return the change in coins corresponding to the user input in the minimum number of coins. 

### DrawingTriangles

After obtaining user input (any integer from 1 to 20 - inclusive), an isosceles triangle with number of rows corresponding to the user input will be printed. 

### PascalsTriangle

Similar to DrawingTriangles, this program obtains user input, and based on said input, it will print out a triangle. In this case, it will print out Pascal's Triangle, with appropriate spacing. 

### PhoneBook

Given a list of names and phone numbers, this program utilizes structures, linked lists, and dynamic allocation to create a phonebook to organize all the contacts and their information. It can alphabetize all contacts to list them, print the phone numbers for a contact, find duplicate entries, and delete contacts.

### Reversi

This program is a creation of the board game Reversi, with employment of AI to play against the user. Using functions, two-dimensional arrays, and smart algorithms, the game is played on an n x n board. The user and computer place tiles on the board, with goals of having the largest amount of tiles once the entire board has been filled or there are no more moves.
