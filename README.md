This repository contains projects written in C++ language from September 2021 to December 2021. 


### ShapesDatabase

With the use of I/O streams, error handling, classes & objects, dynamic allocation, double pointers, and arrays, this program can store a database of shapes. After user input (consisting of a combination of strings) is obtained, a variety of error checking is employed, including checking for number of arguments inputted and validity of said arguments. If no errors are found, the shape can then be created, moved, rotated, drawn, or deleted (specified by user). 

### ShapesList

This program's purpose is very similar as to that of ShapesDatabase. However, instead of using double pointers and arrays, this uses linked lists. Through the use of linked lists within linked lists, the program creates a list of groups with shapes within each one. Then, at the end of the program, it deallocates everything that was dynamically allocated to avoid memory leaks. 

### ShapesParenting

Using inheritance and virtual functions, this program implements a database of shapes that stores and manipulates new shapes. 

### TicTacToe

This program is a recreation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. Using classes, objects, and methods, along with separate compilation, the program can be used as a multi-player game, with move validity-checking and win code determination.
